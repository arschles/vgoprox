Welcome, Gopher! We're really glad you're considering contributing to Athens. We'd like to briefly introduce you to our community before you get started.

## Our philosophy

We have three things (below) that we'd like you to keep in mind while you're contributing to the community. We won't always do all of these perfectly because, well, nobody's perfect!

Our goal is to try our best.

### Be nice to each other

We think that people are more important than code all the time, every time. We don't ignore code or settle for subpar technology, but we think that if we focus on our relationships with each other, we'll end up with both a better community and above-par technology anyway

### Make development and testing easy

Well, as easy as possible. This helps us reduce cognitive load so we can focus on Athens, not setting up our dev/test environment.

### Focus on the community

>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together

We all try to follow this proverb. We try to get as many people involved as we can, we do (almost) everything 100% transparently, and we trust each other to do the right thing.

We have a [philosophy section](/contributing/community/philosophy/) of these docs details our philosophy. For now, the above three sections are fine. If you get more involved with our project, we encourage you to read it. 

## Rules

Generally speaking, we don't make policies before we need them. We prefer looking at patterns and considering our philosophy before we come up with a rule. This goes for things like deciding on a new requirement for pull request reviews and more.

However, we have **one non-negotiable rule, our our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gomods/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

>We have no requirements for joining our community, except that you click on that link and get familiar with our code of conduct

Unfortunately, I have to say this: _not knowing about or code of conduct is not an excuse for bad behavior. We enforce the code of conduct the same for everybody_.

If you see a violation of our code of conduct, there are instructions under [enforcement](https://github.com/gomods/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#enforcement) for what to do.

## Next steps

Now that all of that's out of the way, we hope you like what you see in Athens, and we'd love for you to get involved!

We welcome any contributor, regardless of who you are or what your experience/skill level is. We've tried to add a section below for all of the skill levels that we could.

### If you're familiar with Git and GitHub basics

Please read the [how to participate in the Athens community](./community/participating) document to learn about how we organize ourselves and how to get started.

### If you're new to Git and GitHub

If you're new to Git and GitHub, please check out our [guide for new contributors to open source](./new).

When you're done with that, please come back here, and check out the section I mentioned above!

### If the above sections don't apply to you

Looks like we didn't add enough sections! Come talk to one of us in our chat room. Here's how to join:

- First, get an invite to the [Slack](https://slack.com/) group [here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
    - Your invite should come almost right away
- Next, find the `#athens` channel
- You can ask a question in there if you're comfortable. You can also just introduce yourself!

### I'm a new maintainer of the project

We have some [documentation written just for you](./maintainers).
