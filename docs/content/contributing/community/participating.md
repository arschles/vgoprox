Thanks for considering participating in the Athens community!

I want to start by saying:

>Absolutely everyone is welcome to join our community at any time, regardless of who you are or your experience level

We are a friendly and inclusive group and we'd love to have you. We only ask that you follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/gomods/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Ways to get involved

You don't need to do anything fancy to contribute, and there are many ways beyond code that you can do so. Below is a list of some of the ways you can get involved. We know at least one person who has already gotten involved in each of these ways:

We'll provide all the support we can possibly provide to help you contribute in any way you'd like. If you're considering joining us, here are some ideas for how you can get involved:

- Comment on an [issue](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues) that you're interested in, or have a question on
- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/gomods/athens/pulls) (PR) to fix an issue
    - You can also submit a PR to do something that isn't already an issue. We recommend that if you want to make a big change, you do talk to us first
- Review a PR that you're interested in
- Ask a question in a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/gomods/athens/discussions)

If you don't see something in the list above that suits you, come chat with us - or introduce yourself! - in the [gophers slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) in the `#athens` channel.
