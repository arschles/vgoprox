## Welcome to Athens

Athens is the name of the combined project that includes a global registry for [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and a stand-alone proxy server that can be deployed on-premise to storage and control available Go modules for your organization. [Like what you hear? Try Athens Now!](/try-out)

##  Next Steps
* If you are interested
in what is happening between the proxy and the Go Modules feature, the [Walkthrough](/walkthrough)
explores this in greater depth.
* For more detailed information on how to run Athens in production, check out our other documentation (coming soon!!).
