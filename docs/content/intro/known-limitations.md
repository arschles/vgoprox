Go Modules is still behind an experimental flag and therefore it's important to know how Athens can help you *now* until Go Modules is standardized and on by default.

#### What Athens can do well _now_ 

- Athens works well within a CI/CD system that installs your modules without needing a vendor folder.
- Athens works well inside your own company without exposing it to unlimited public traffic.
