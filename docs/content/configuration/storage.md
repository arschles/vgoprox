## Storage

The Athens proxy supports many storage types:

1. [Memory](#memory)
1. [Disk](#disk)
1. [Mongo](#mongo)
1. [Google Cloud Storage](#google-cloud-storage)
1. [AWS S3](#aws-s3)
1. [Minio](#minio)
1. [DigitalOcean Spaces](#digitalocean-spaces)
1. [Alibaba OSS](#alibaba-oss)

All of them can be configured using `config.toml` file. You need to set a valid driver in `StorageType` value or you can set it in environment variable `ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE` on your server.
Also for most of the drivers you need to provide additional configuration data which will be described below.

## Memory

This storage doesn't need any specific configuration and it's also used by default in the Athens project. It writes all of data into local disk into `tmp` dir.

**This storage type should only be used for development purposes!**

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "memory"

## Disk

Disk storage allows modules to be stored on a file system. The location on disk where modules will be stored can be configured.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "disk"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Disk]
            RootPath = "/path/on/disk"

where `/path/on/disk` is your desired location. Also it can be set using `ATHENS_DISK_STORAGE_ROOT` env

## Mongo

This driver uses a [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) server as data storage. On start this driver will create an `athens` database and `module` collection on your Mongo server.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "mongo"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Mongo]
            # Full URL for mongo storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_STORAGE_URL
            URL = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

            # Not required parameter
            # Path to certificate to use for the mongo connection
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_CERT_PATH
            CertPath = "/path/to/cert/file"

            # Not required parameter
            # Allows for insecure SSL / http connections to mongo storage
            # Should be used for testing or development only
            # Env override: ATHENS_MONGO_INSECURE
            Insecure = false

## Google Cloud Storage

This driver uses [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) and assumes that you already have an `account` and `bucket` in it.
If you never used Google Cloud Storage there is [quick guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console)
how to create `bucket` inside it.

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "gcp"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.GCP]
            # ProjectID to use for GCP Storage
            # Env overide: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
            ProjectID = "YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID"

            # Bucket to use for GCP Storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_GCP_BUCKET
            Bucket = "YOUR_GCP_BUCKET"

## AWS S3

This driver is using the [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and assumes that you already have `account` and `bucket` created in it.
If you never used Amazon Web Services there is [quick guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html) how to create `bucket` inside it.
After this you can pass you credentials inside `config.toml` file

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "s3"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.S3]
            # Region on which your S3 storage exists
            # Env override: AWS_REGION
            Region = "YOUR_AWS_REGION"

            # Access Key to your account
            # Env override: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"

            # Secret Key to your account
            # Env override: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

            # Not required parameter
            # Session Token for S3 storage
            # Env override: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
            Token = ""

            # S3 Bucket to use for storage
            # Defaults to gomods
            # Env override: ATHENS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"

## Minio

[Minio](https://www.minio.io/) is an open source object storage server. If you never used minio you can read this [quick start guide](https://docs.minio.io/)

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Endpoint for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "127.0.0.1:9001"

            # Access Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY"

            # Secret Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL for Minio connections
            # Defaults to true
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = false

            # Minio Bucket to use for storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "gomods"

## DigitalOcean Spaces

For Athens to communicate with [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), we are using Minio driver because DO Spaces tries to be [fully compatible with it](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/).
Also configuration for this storage looks almost the same in our proxy as for [Minio](#minio).

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Address of DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "YOUR_ADDRESS.digitaloceanspaces.com"

            # Access Key for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_KEY_ID"

            # Secret Key for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = true

            # Space name in your DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_NAME"

            # Region for DO Spaces storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_REGION
            Region = "YOUR_DO_SPACE_REGION"

## Alibaba OSS

For Athens to communicate with [Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss), we are using Minio driver.
Also configuration for this storage looks almost the same in our proxy as for [Minio](#minio).

##### Configuration:

    # StorageType sets the type of storage backend the proxy will use.
    # Env override: ATHENS_STORAGE_TYPE
    StorageType = "minio"

    [Storage]
        [Storage.Minio]
            # Address of Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ENDPOINT
            Endpoint = "YOUR_ADDRESS.aliyuncs.com"

            # Access Key for Minio storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            Key = "YOUR_OSS_KEY_ID"

            # Secret Key for Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            Secret = "YOUR_OSS_SECRET_KEY"

            # Enable SSL
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_USE_SSL
            EnableSSL = true

            # Parent folder in your Alibaba OSS storage
            # Env override: ATHENS_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME
            Bucket = "YOUR_OSS_FOLDER_PREFIX"
